Patch 4 supercedes all prior patches. Patches are not incremental. Patch 4 includes
all changes from earlier versions.

Patch 4 adds three new functions that allow to influence sound effects as they are
playing. You may change the pitch of the effect, its volume and query if the effect
for which you have an ID is still active (unless the same ID has been reassigned to
a new sound effect, which is a rare case).


snd_SFXActive	(+69)
	In:
		A <- FX ID to check for
	Out:
		ZF <- 1  (Z) if not active
		      0 (NZ) if active



snd_SFXPitch	(+72)
	In:
		A <- FX ID to set pitch for
		DE <- Pitch to set.
		      D is the key number (36-119, key 36 is C-0, 119 is H#6)
			  E is the cent detune (0-99 mapped onto 0-255)

			  A steady increase of DE as a 16 bit value is acceptable

	Out:
		Nothing

	Note: Can safely be called on Sound4 (noise generator), but has no effect there of course.



snd_SFXVolume	(+75)
	In:
		A <- FX ID to set new volume for
		E <- Volume to set (0-15)
			 This will be scaled with the SFX master volume

	Out:
		Nothing
