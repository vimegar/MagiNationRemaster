*** BUGS ***

* Fix water of life so it boosts your current energy by 5 as well as max

* Fix the speed+luck turn order bug: https://github.com/GauChoob/magination/blob/main/source/banks/bank_003.asm#L6084

*** FEATURES ***

* Fix creature energy logic so max energy >250 is allowed

* Make XP numbers show up in battle somehow (bouncing numbers)?


*** CREATURE IDENTITY AND BALANCE ***
Gum-Gum: Some sort of obnoxious utility to make its redirect ability a source of pressure
- low-chance, low-damage OHKO?

Karak/Shadow Karak: Raise ATK but low EN and DEF--make reliant on redirect for survivability

*** ABILITY IDENTITY AND BALANCE ***

Shade: Higher EN cost, but small chance of confuse?

Root: Small drain
Leaf: maybe also gets a drain? doesn't make too much sense...


*** NEW ABILITY IDEAS ***

Diversion: Grant an ally redirect
