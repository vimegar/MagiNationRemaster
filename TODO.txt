*** BUGS ***

- Game freeze during the first dialogue with Gia

- When saving with Gia, it shows Tony's portrait when it should show Gia's

- After Pruitt forges you a ring, she remains in the "holding ring" animation until you talk to her again or leave

*** FEATURES ***

* Fix creature energy logic so max energy >250 is allowed

* Make XP numbers show up in battle somehow (bouncing numbers)?

* Swap stat gain index selection to LEVEL + STAT_INDEX % 10
-- maybe % 8 would be better? make the stat gain tables length 8


*** CREATURE IDENTITY AND BALANCE ***
Gum-Gum: Maybe Trip should deal damage based on the enemy's max energy instead?

Borgor: Give a low-accuracy ability that halves target's HP

*** ABILITY IDENTITY AND BALANCE ***

None atm...

*** NEW ABILITY IDEAS ***

Diversion: Grant an ally redirect
