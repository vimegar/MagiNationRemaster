Pre-git repo changes:
Source/Game/Battle/Tables/CreatureName_Table.s:232
Changed "Sabreback" to "Magma Jile"

Soruce/Game/Battle/Commands/BtlCmd_Formula.s:85
Added new SKILL_FUNC_NORES function that calculates skill-based damage, ignoring resistance 

Source/Game/Battle/Commands/BtlCmd_Func.s:1382
Changed CMD_FUNC_HEAL's damage override calculation to be the result of SKILL_FUNC_NORES instead of a random number.

RANDVAL changes:
These are also in git but I'm keeping notes here for quick reference.

Battle_Helpers.s ?BTL_BOOTY
Added a SWAP A after the call to RANDVAL in _NO_CASH because the first animite drop seemed to break with the improved RANDOM.
